COMPILING

Need to deal with the "Complex" struct in 
typedefs.h; float2 is apparently a CUDA thing.
Do we include the relevant cuda headers in the 
header for typedefs.h? Or do we abandon that
approach to the complex datatype -- used because
you can cast it to cuComplex.

MEMORY MANAGEMENT

* finalize()
* Cuda free calls

TESTING

* Finish main.cpp; test against known cases
